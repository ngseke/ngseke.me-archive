年之冬，是我與大學好友鎧企（K7）攜手開發的大專院校音樂平台。我們皆來自吉他社，體認到各個賽事在籌辦時的痛點，於是樂台計畫應運而生，宗旨是打造更優質的音樂賽事環境，簡化社團在處理報名業務的作業流程。</p> <p>在上線屆滿一年來，樂台計畫傾聽了來自各方用戶的反饋和建議，持續優化系統與擴展規模。</p> <p>對於參賽者，樂台計畫以 Line App 官方帳號的形式，讓用戶輕鬆簡單地報名參賽，瀏覽各賽事的詳細資訊，還有查看當前比賽進度等功能。目前用戶數已超過 6,000 人，全台從北到南，共計有 26 所大專院校的音樂社團與我們成為合作夥伴。</p> <p>而對於主辦比賽的社團成員們，樂台計畫提供一套完整的後台管理系統。 在此項目中本人負責的是<strong>後台管理系統</strong>開發與部分 Line App <strong>UI/UX 設計</strong>。</p> <p><img src=\\\"\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACEMENT_1___ + \"\\\" alt=\\\"管理後台概覽頁面(Dashboard)\\\"></p> <p>管理後台基於 Vuetify 建置，借助這些開箱即用的 Material Design 風格組件，使我們在在初期得以快速地迭代原型。 <img
